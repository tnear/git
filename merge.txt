$ git checkout main

# Next, merge the branch into main:

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

# This modifies the file(s) in question:

<<<<<<< HEAD
main hello!
=======
branch hello!
>>>>>>> feature-c

# First, modify the file and save changes:
$ vi hello.txt

$ cat hello.txt
hello
branch hello!

# Finally, run "git commit" with no message because this continues previous operation:
$ git commit
[main 4cee47f] Merge branch 'feature-c'

# 'Merge branch now appears at top'
$ git log --oneline
4cee47f (HEAD -> main) Merge branch 'feature-c'
